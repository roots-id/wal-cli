# wal-cli
CLI Identity Wallet Implementation

## Requirements:

- Gradle version 7, or newer  

- Install Mongodb: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community  
  **note:** WAL will connect to mongodb on localhost:27017

- Set the following environment variables:

  - IOG Repository credentials:    
    `PRISM_SDK_USER = (Request to IOG)`  
    `PRISM_SDK_PASSWORD = (Request to IOG)`

  - Atala PRISM Node host and port:  
    `PRISM_NODE_HOST = (Request to IOG)`  
    `PRISM_NODE_PORT = (Request to IOG, default 50053)`
  - Atala PRISM protocol and token:
    `PRISM_NODE_PROTOCOL = http`
    `PRISM_NODE_TOKEN = null`

  - Github credentials, generate a personal access token 
  [(PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with **read:packages** option enabled.    
    `GITHUB_USER = <github user>`      
    `GITHUB_TOKEN = <PAT Token>`  
## Installation

# Important  

The tool isn't intended for production use. Its design doesn't contemplate security. Data is stored in the database in plain text to expose the semantics and facilitate inspection. Eventually, an encryption layer will be added but right now is not a priority.
